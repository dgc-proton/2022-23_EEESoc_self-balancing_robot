# Self Balancing Robot

This repository contains files relating to the final version of a self-balancing robot built by Dave & Anoop to enter the 2022-23 Aberdeen University Electrical & Electronic Engineering Society Robotics League; a self balancing robot competition.

The competition had 7 events which all competitors had to compete in:

- Self-balancing for time
- Self-balancing for time with added weight
- Maximum distance in a straight line
- Maximum distance in a straight line with added weight
- Maximum distance going up an incline
- Maximum distance going up an incline with added weight
- Robot wrestling (this was a suprise event that was revealed during the competition)

Overall our robot came in second place in the competition. I performed particularly well in the suprise wrestling round due to our remote control implementation.
